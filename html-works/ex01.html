      The Overseas Telecommunications Commission (OTC) was established by an Act
      of Parliament in August 1946.[5] It inherited facilities and resources
      from Amalgamated Wireless Australasia Limited (AWA) and Cable & Wireless,
      and was charged with responsibility for all international
      telecommunications services into, through and out of Australia.[6] On 1
      February 1992, it was merged with Australia's domestic telecommunications
      carrier, the Australian Telecommunications Corporation Limited
      ("Telecom"), to create the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications
      Corporation Limited (AOTC). The new organisation underwent a corporate
      identity review and was subsequently renamed Telstra Corporation Limited
      ("Telstra") for international business in 1993 and domestic business in
      1995.[3] Privatisation Beginning in 1997 and finalizing in 2011, the
      federal government began to privatise the corporation. The first three
      stages were initiated by the Liberal–National Coalition's Howard
      Government: the first, informally known as "T1" (with shares priced at
      $3.30), occurred in 1997. "T2" ($7.40) followed in 1999; "T3" ($3.60) in
      2006.[3][7] In T1, the government sold one third of its shares in Telstra
      for A$14 billion and publicly listed the company on the Australian Stock
      Exchange.[7] In 1998, a further 16% of Telstra shares were sold to the
      public, leaving the Australian government with 51% ownership. In 2006, T3
      was announced by the government and was the largest of the three public
      releases, reducing the government's ownership of Telstra to 17%.[8] The
      17% remainder of Telstra was placed in Australia's Future Fund, a
      sovereign wealth fund established mainly to meet future liabilities for
      payment of superannuation to retired federal public servants.[9] In 2009,
      the Future Fund sold off another $2.4 billion worth of shares, reducing
      the government's stake in Telstra to 10.9%.[10] In August 2011, under
      Labor's Gillard Government, the Future Fund sold its remaining "above
      market weight" Telstra shares, effectively completing Telstra's
      privatisation.[11] With more than one million shareholders, Telstra is
      currently the most widely held ASX-listed company.[12] Telstra phone

      National Broadband Network On 26 November 2008, Telstra submitted a
      non-complying tender issued by the federal government to build a National
      Broadband Network, a 12-page letter proposing a $5 billion broadband
      network covering between 80 and 90 percent of the Australian population in
      major cities, despite the tender requiring 98 percent coverage.[13][14] As
      a result, Telstra was removed from the National Broadband Network RFP
      process on 15 December 2008.[15] In response, Telstra announced that it
      would raise speeds on its existing Next G network and HFC "cable" network
      so that they both offer higher speeds than the RFP for the NBN
      requires.[16] Following Telstra's exclusion from the National Broadband
      Network bidding process Telstra's share price suffered the biggest one-day
      percentage fall in its history.[17] NBN Co Limited signed a definitive
      agreement with Telstra on 23 June 2011, estimated to be worth A$9 billion
      post-tax net present value,[18] building upon the signing of a financial
      heads of agreement a year beforehand.[19] Telstra agreed to
      "disconnect"[20] its Internet customers from the copper and hybrid
      fibre-coaxial networks in areas where FTTP has been installed, and agreed
      to lease dark fibre, exchange space and ducts to NBN Co. As part of the
      agreement, Telstra would not be able to market their mobile network as an
      alternative to the NBN for a number of years.[18] Telstra remains the
      owner of its networks.[21] On 18 October 2011, Telstra shareholders
      overwhelmingly approved the deal.[22] On 14 December 2014 it was announced
      that in a A$11b renegotiated deal Telstra will transfer ownership of its
      copper and hybrid fibre-coaxial (HFC) networks to NBN while disconnecting
      premises from these networks. This ownership allows NBN Co to use these
      networks "where it sees fit in for its multi-technology NBN rollout."[23]

      Microsoft Corporation (/maɪkroʊ.sɒft/) is an American multinational
      technology company with headquarters in Redmond, Washington. It develops,
      manufactures, licenses, supports, and sells computer software, consumer
      electronics, personal computers, and related services. Its best known
      software products are the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, the
      Microsoft Office suite, and the Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers.
      Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the
      Microsoft Surface lineup of touchscreen personal computers. In 2016, it
      was the world's largest software maker by revenue (currently
      Alphabet/Google has more revenue).[3] The word "Microsoft" is a
      portmanteau of "microcomputer software".[4] Microsoft ranked No. 21 in the
      2020 Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by
      total revenue.[5] It is considered one of the Big Five technology
      companies alongside Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook. Microsoft was
      founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell
      BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the personal
      computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by
      Microsoft Windows. The company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO), and
      subsequent rise in its share price, created three billionaires and an
      estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s,
      it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market and has
      made a number of corporate acquisitions, their largest being the
      acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in December 2016,[6] followed by
      their acquisition of Skype Technologies for $8.5 billion in May 2011.[7]
      As of 2015, Microsoft is market-dominant in the IBM PC compatible
      operating system market and the office software suite market, although it
      has lost the majority of the overall operating system market to
      Android.[8] The company also produces a wide range of other consumer and
      enterprise software for desktops, laptops, tabs, gadgets, and servers,
      including Internet search (with Bing), the digital services market
      (through MSN), mixed reality (HoloLens), cloud computing (Azure), and
      software development (Visual Studio). Steve Ballmer replaced Gates as CEO
      in 2000, and later envisioned a "devices and services" strategy.[9] This
      unfolded with Microsoft acquiring Danger Inc. in 2008,[10] entering the
      personal computer production market for the first time in June 2012 with
      the launch of the Microsoft Surface line of tablet computers, and later
      forming Microsoft Mobile through the acquisition of Nokia's devices and
      services division. Since Satya Nadella took over as CEO in 2014, the
      company has scaled back on hardware and has instead focused on cloud
      computing, a move that helped the company's shares reach its highest value
      since December 1999.[11][12] Earlier dethroned by Apple in 2010, in 2018
      Microsoft reclaimed its position as the most valuable publicly traded
      company in the world.[13] In April 2019, Microsoft reached the
      trillion-dollar market cap, becoming the third U.S. public company to be
      valued at over $1 trillion after Apple and Amazon respectively.[14]
